Incorporated code
-----------------

  (i) Support for the TIGER cryptographic checksum algorithm
  is provided by the reference implementation, which includes 
  the following statement:

	 * Tiger: A Fast New Hash Function
	 *
	 * Ross Anderson and Eli Biham
	 *
	 * Tiger has no usage restrictions nor patents. It can be used freely, 
	 * with the reference implementation, 
	 * with other implementations or with 
	 * a modification to the reference implementation (as long as it still 
	 * implements Tiger). We only ask you to let us know about your 
	 * implementation and to cite the origin of Tiger and of the reference 
	 * implementation. 
	 *
	 * The authors' home pages can be found both in 
	 * http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~biham/ and in 
	 * http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/.
	 * The authors' email addresses are biham@cs.technion.ac.il 
	 * and rja14@cl.cam.ac.uk.



  (ii) Support for testing write access by untrusted users
  to any element in the path of a file is provided by the
  public domain trustfile library, which includes the following
  statement:

	 * Author information:
	 * Matt Bishop
	 * Department of Computer Science
	 * University of California at Davis
	 * Davis, CA  95616-8562
	 * phone (916) 752-8060
	 * email bishop@cs.ucdavis.edu
	 *
	 * This code is placed in the public domain.  I do ask that
	 * you keep my name associated with it, that you not represent
	 * it as written by you, and that you preserve these comments.
	 * This software is provided "as is" and without any guarantees
	 * of any sort.

  (iii) Support for big integer arithmetic is provided by the bignum
  package (v. 1.2) by Henrik.Johansson@Nexus.Comm.SE,

        * Everyone is allowed to distribute this package to anyone
        * else, as long as all changes are recorded and mentioned.
        * If you are including this in a commercial product, be sure
        * to distribute _all_ of the package with the product.
	*
        * (...writing more stuff here later, but I guess everyone
        * knows the approximate contents of it - no warranty, no
        * charge, and so on.  I guess it is like the GNU concept.
        * Read that for further details...)
