samhain (3.1.0-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: Add an option to disable the ASM code when building
    on amd64 targets. Work around to fix the FTBFS on amd64 and kfreebsd
    (Closes: #735530) 
    Patch provided by Adam Conrad.
  * debian/control: Change build-deps to add autotools-dev. Build on new
    architectures will get config.{sub,guess} automatically without you needing
    to do a fresh upload to update the diff.
    Patch provided by Adam Conrad.
  * debian/samhain.init,debian/postinst: Initialise the integrity database if
    it does not exist the first time the init.d script is run, do not do it in
    postinst. This prevents package installation from sending a mail to root
    which causes problems in automated testing tools (such as piuparts)
    (Closes: #749602)
  * debian/samhain.init: Fix call to pidofproc, provide it with the required
    arguments (Closes: #751747) (LP: #1330424)

samhain (3.1.0-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/samhainrc: Use 'root@localhost' for SetMailAddress instead of just
    'root' since the basic mailer configuration requires that a domain is
    provided in the RCPT TO.
  * debian/samhain.init: Improve the init script:    
    - Do not fail in 'start' if the daemon is already started, use --oknodo
      (Closes: #736375)        
    - Do not try to stop the daemon (and wait for it to stop) if it is not running
    - If the pidfile has been lost, try to determine the status using the
      process name instead
  * debian/control: Do not require libauparse-dev in kfreebsd (Closes: #736169)
  * debian/rules: update config.{sub,guess} on build if available and restore
    on clean

samhain (3.1.0-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules:
    - Disable dnmalloc for all architectures expect those known to work. It
      seems to be the source of problems and segfaults in many different
      architectures (Closes: #533860, #657307)

      Even though dnmalloc improves samhain's security this is done to avoid
      potential problematic situations while we wait more information from
      upstream indicating in which architectures dnmalloc() can
      be safely enabled.

 -- Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <jfs@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jan 2014 03:30:24 +0100

samhain (3.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules:
    - Disable dnmalloc for s390x, as it is done for s390 already 
      (Closes: #733875)
    - Preliminary code to build server (yule) and client although. This a
      first step to fix #343346
  * debian/control
    - Add libauparse-dev to the Build-dependencies to ensure that audit
      support is enabled (Closes: #700156)

 -- Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <jfs@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jan 2014 01:57:57 +0100

samhain (3.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #733468, #700109)
  * This new upstream release builds with gcc 4.8 (Closes: #701353)
  * Fix use of /var/run/samhain, which is created by the init.d script since
    version 2.6.2-1:
        - Remove the /var/run/samhain directory when the package is purged
        - Do not ship /var/run/samhain in the package file
    Thanks go to Thomas Goirand for spotting this issue and providing a patch,
    which I used as a basis for the above changes
    (Closes: #689902)
  * Default samhainrc now uses SetMailAddress=root, SetMailRelay=localhost
    since there have been reports of the previous confguration
    (SetMailAddress=root@localhost, SetMailRelay=NULL) not working since
    samhain tries to retrieve an MX record for 'localhost' from the DNS
    (Closes: 709753)

samhain (2.8.3a-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #602678)
    - Remove call to sstrip in Makefile.in
  * debian/samhain.init: 
    - Do not try to remove stale lockfile, its location was not 
      correct (it was /var/log/samhain/samhain.lock) and samhain
      will start nevertheless (Closes: 645678)
    - When restarting, check if the daemon is running before attempting
      to start it and complain if it's still there
    - Add a 'status' call to check if the daemon is running.
  [ Changes by Stephen Gran ]
  * debian/rules:
    - Disable dnmalloc where we know it doesn't work (Closes: #618728, #501232)
      According to upstream documentation dnmalloc doesn't work AMD64
      architectures including ia64 and freebsd-amd64
      (http://www.la-samhna.de/samhain/manual/dnmalloc.html)
  * debian/samhain.init, debian/samhain.logrotate.d:
    - Switch back to /var/run/samhain, as /var/run is now a symlink to /run,
      and samhain won't run if it's piddir is a symlink. 
      (Closes: #645016, #631580)

samhain (2.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change configuration so that the pidfile used is /var/run/samhain.pid
    instead of /var/run/samhain/samhain.pid

    and source (although the rmel alignment bug is currently commented
    out) (Closes: #502820)
  * Updated config.sub and config.guess (Closes: #539945)
  * debian/rules changes:
      - Use pidfile checks to stop the daemon  (Closes: #533859)
      - Use LSB messages
  * Add /var/log/samhain/supervise to the directories to remove when purging
  (this directory was created in older versions of Samhain)
  * Include translations to debconf templates:
     - Danish translation, provided by Joe Dalton (Closes: #586240)
     - Brazilian Portuguese, provided by Flamarion Jorge  (Closes: #619250)

samhain (2.5.4-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, upload to experimental since it uses a new
  dnmalloc allocator as a security measure against heap buffer overflows

samhain (2.2.3-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Take over maintainership. Previous upload was not a proper NMU.
    - Acknowledge changes in previous NMU. Actually, the fix 
      to the init.d script also fixed a long-standing bug, which had the same
      symptoms (Closes: #499799, #255435)

    (Closes: #312276)
  * Add additional files to the default samhainrc as suggested by Olleg
    Samoylov (Closes: #394622)

    stripped, let dh_strip do his job (Closes: 437948)

samhain (2.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

    introduces a FTBFS currently. Should be reenabled once this
    issue is fixed (Closes: #382617)

 -- Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pen~a <jfs@computer.org>  Sat, 19 Aug 2006 10:38:36 +0200

samhain (2.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to latest release
  * Make samhain's configuration file mode 640 (instead of 644, users
    don't need to read this file)
  * Modify default samhainrc so it does not include /usr/X11R6/bin since
    in the latest Xorg (v7) packages this directory is now a symlink
    (Closes: #378320)
  * Add /etc/nologin to the IgnoreAll section as suggested by Olleg Samoylov
    (Closes: #381859)
  * Add debconf translation to Portuguese contributed by Rui Branco (Note: had
    to change the PO-Revision-Date since it was not properly defined and had
    the default value) (Closes: #381446)
  * Further modify Makefile.in so 'sstrip' doesn't even get compiled (as we
    don't use it or redistribute it), it is also a pain to maintain as it
    includes kernel headers and breaks occasionally.

      been moved in upstream sources
  * Since profiles have been removed provide a samhainrc file under debian/
    - This new samhainrc file is based in the samhainrc.linux file with
      the default values used in previous releases. It changes, however,
      the mail subject so it's clearer to the admin that the messages
      are sent by samhain.
