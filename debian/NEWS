samhain (2.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 2.5.4 samhain uses the dnmalloc allocator as a proactive
  security measure against heap buffer overflows. If you experience stability
  problems, please report these issues as a bug report against the Debian
  package providing information on your architecture. 
  
  As a workaround you can use the sources and use recompile them using
  --disable-dnmalloc flag.

samhain (1.7.10-4) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 1.7.10-4 the postinst has been fixed and the integrity
  database will not be initialized each time the package is upgrade.
  Previous versions would do so and, as a consequence, the 
  /var/state/samhain/samhain_file would be appended an will grow with
  each upgrade. Users that have frequently upgraded samhain are suggested
  to review the size of that file and consider (if it's too big, i.e
  over 2-3 MBs) to purge it and re-run 'samhain -t init' to recreate it.
  When I find a good way to detect appended databases code will be added
  to the package management scripts in order to remove and regenerate it 
  (just in case some users suffer from this issue).
