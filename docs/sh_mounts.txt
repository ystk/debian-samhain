Documentation for sh_mounts, the samhain "Mounts" module.
---------------------------------------------------------
sh_mounts implements functionality we had in a policy-checking Perl script we
have here at eircom; basically, all it does is ensure that certain mounts are
there (for example, /, /tmp, /var, /usr, /home) and that certain options are
specified on those mounts (for example noexec,nosuid on /tmp).

All quite simple. It wouldn't be too hard to extend this module somewhat, to
report any NFS mounts found, for example, or to test that _only_ the mounts
specified are mounted on the machine.

Here's a bit for the manual:

Checking mounted filesystem policies
------------------------------------
samhain can be compiled to check if certain filesystems are mounted, and if they
are mounted with the appropriate options. This module currently supports Linux,
Solaris and FreeBSD. The configuration of the module is done in the Mounts 
section of the configuration file:

-------->8---------

[Mounts]
#
# Activate (0 is off).
#
MountCheckActive=1

#
# Interval between checks.
#
MountCheckInterval=7200

#
# Logging severities. We have two checks: to see if a mount is there, and to
# see if it is mounted with the correct options.
#
SeverityMountMissing=warn
SeverityOptionMissing=warn

#
# Mounts to check for, followed by lists of options to check on them.
#
checkmount=/
checkmount=/var
checkmount=/usr
checkmount=/tmp noexec,nosuid,nodev 
checkmount=/home noexec,nosuid,nodev

-------->8---------

The module is enabled as part of the compilation of samhain by specifying
--enable-mounts-check
