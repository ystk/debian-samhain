Checking sensitive files owned by users.
------------------------------------
samhain can be compiled to support checking of files that are specified
as being relative to the a user's home directory.  It is intended to
detect interference with files that influence process behaviour such as
.profile
It simply adds the appropriate file entries to the main samhain list, at
the specified alerting level.
